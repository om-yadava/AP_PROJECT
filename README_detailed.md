## 📖 Project Overview

Travelp functions as a digital travel guide, highlighting various global destinations like Barcelona, Bali, Africa, and more. Each destination is mapped to its own dedicated PHP page containing images, videos, and descriptive content. JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity, while multimedia files create an immersive user experience.

This project is particularly useful for showcasing:
- Dynamic web development using PHP
- Integration of media assets in web pages
- Simple data flow between front-end and back-end logic

---

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Responsive homepage showcasing multiple destinations
- 🗺️ Destination-specific pages powered by PHP
- 🎥 Embedded videos and high-resolution image galleries
- ⚙️ JavaScript for dynamic UI behavior (e.g., loading content or interactive elements)

## 🗂 Sample Pages

- `barcelona.php` - Highlights Barcelona
- `aboutus.php` - Information about the platform/team
- `africa.php` - African destinations
- Other locations include Bali, Europe, etc.

---

## 🖼 Media Handling

- Images and videos are embedded directly within PHP pages.
- Supports high-definition media and adaptive layouts.
- All media is statically served (no CDN dependency).

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Ensure PHP code does not expose file paths or server configs.
- Avoid direct user input unless sanitized properly.
- No authentication module is included (can be added later).

---

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

- Optimize images for web (currently in full quality).
- Implement lazy loading for media-heavy pages.
- Consider caching if dynamic data is introduced.
